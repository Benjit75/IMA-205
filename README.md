# IMA-205: Machine learning for images and object recognition
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course IMA-205 at Télécom Paris

This course presents the main machine learning techniques used for image analysis. More precisely:
 
- Introduction to Unsupervised Learning (curse of dimensionality, PCA, ICA, NNMF)
- Introduction to Supervised Learning (overfitting, OLS, Ridge, LASSO, LDA, QDA)
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Decision tree and Random Forests
- Ensemble learning
- Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Learn the principles and hypothesis behind the different machine learning techniques
- Understand the pros and cons of each method 
- Learn how to use them on real high-dimensional data (Big Data)
